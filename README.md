## Hi
This is a brief introduction like usual.
As for purpose of this project is to motivate myself to learn git and share my learning to people who just get started.
It will start from very simple concepts and keep moving towards deeper knowledge and more practical use in real world, so it will be splipted into 
different sections. However you will still need some basic use and understanding to git before you move on.
If you already have some experiences of git, then I hope it works for you.
